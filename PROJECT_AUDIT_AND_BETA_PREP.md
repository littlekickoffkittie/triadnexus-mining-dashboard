# Project Audit and Beta Release Preparation Plan

## Project Overview
- TriadNexus Mining is a blockchain mining system with a visual dashboard built using Next.js, Hardhat, and TypeScript.
- The system includes:
  - Smart contract (TriadToken.sol) implementing an ERC20 token with mining rewards.
  - Deployment scripts using Hardhat and ethers.js v6.
  - A Next.js frontend app for user interface.
  - CLI mining dashboard for real-time mining visualization.
  - Utilities and mining logic in shared libraries.

## Current Status
- Deployment script updated and fixed for ethers.js v6 compatibility.
- Basic deployment and initial token transfer functionality verified.
- Mining dashboard CLI and frontend components exist.
- Project structure is well organized.

## Audit Findings and Recommendations

### 1. Smart Contract (contracts/TriadToken.sol)
- Review and audit the smart contract for security and gas optimization.
- Add comprehensive unit tests covering all contract functions and edge cases.
- Consider adding events for key actions if not already present.
- Verify tokenomics and mining reward logic correctness.

### 2. Deployment Scripts (scripts/)
- Consolidate deployment scripts; remove deprecated or backup files.
- Add environment validation to ensure required variables (e.g., FOUNDATIONAL_WALLET_ADDRESS) are set.
- Add error handling and logging for better debugging.
- Automate deployment to multiple networks (testnet, mainnet) with config support.

### 3. Frontend (src/app/)
- Complete UI components for full user interaction with mining dashboard.
- Add responsive design and accessibility improvements.
- Integrate real-time data fetching and updates from blockchain.
- Add user authentication and wallet connection support.

### 4. CLI Mining Dashboard (src/cli/)
- Enhance CLI dashboard with more detailed mining stats and controls.
- Add configuration options for mining parameters.
- Improve error handling and user feedback.
- Add logging and export options for mining data.

### 5. Utilities and Mining Logic (src/lib/)
- Refactor and document mining logic for clarity and maintainability.
- Add unit and integration tests for utilities and mining modules.
- Optimize performance-critical code paths.

### 6. Testing and CI/CD
- Set up automated testing pipelines for smart contracts, backend, and frontend.
- Add linting and formatting checks.
- Automate deployment and beta release builds.

### 7. Documentation
- Update README with detailed setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- Add API documentation for frontend and CLI interfaces.
- Document smart contract interfaces and events.

### 8. Security and Auditing
- Conduct security audit of smart contracts and deployment process.
- Review dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Implement best practices for key management and environment security.

## Next Steps for Beta Release Preparation
1. Complete smart contract testing and auditing.
2. Finalize deployment scripts with robust error handling.
3. Enhance frontend and CLI dashboard features and polish UI/UX.
4. Implement automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.
5. Prepare comprehensive documentation.
6. Conduct internal beta testing and gather feedback.
7. Address bugs and performance issues identified during beta.
8. Plan for public beta release and marketing.
