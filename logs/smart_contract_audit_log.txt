TriadToken.sol Smart Contract Audit Log

Audit Summary:
- Contract uses OpenZeppelin's ERC20 and Ownable for security and standard compliance.
- Mining reward logic includes a cooldown to prevent abuse.
- Valid Sierpinski hashes are tracked for mining eligibility.
- Constructor mints initial supply to owner.

Security Observations:
- No reentrancy risk detected as minting is internal and state updated before mint.
- Only owner can add valid hashes, which is appropriate.
- Cooldown enforced using block.timestamp, which is acceptable for this use case.
- No access control issues found.

Gas Optimization Suggestions:
- Consider emitting events for claimMiningReward and addValidSierpinskiHash functions to improve transparency and off-chain tracking.
- Mapping validSierpinskiHashes could be optimized if large, but current usage seems reasonable.
- Use immutable keyword for MINING_REWARD and MINING_COOLDOWN constants to save gas.

Next Steps:
- Add missing events for key actions.
- Implement unit tests covering all functions and edge cases.
